The best way to learn iFEM is to do the following projects designed for Math 226: Numerical PDE in UC Irvine. 

* [Finite Difference Methods in 1-D](projectFDM1D.md)
* [Finite Difference Methods](projectFDM.md)
* [Linear Finite Element Method](projectFEM.md)
* [Fast Multipole Methods](projectFMM.md)
* [Multigrid Methods](projectMG.md)
* [Nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann Equation](projectPBE.md)
* [Adaptive FEM for PBE](projectPBEafem.md)
* [Adaptive FEM for Heat Equation](projectHeat.md) 
* [Finite Element Methods for Stokes equations](projectStokes.md)
* [MAC Scheme for Stokes equations](projectStokesMAC.md)
* [Fast Solvers for Stokes equations](projectStokesSolver.md)
* [Transient Navier-Stokes Equations](projectNavierStokes.md)
* [Edge element for Maxwell Equations](projectMaxwell.md)
* [Wave equations](projectWave.md)
