We have implemented multigrid solvers for linear algebraic systems arising from various finite element methods. Here we briefly present the usage for a symmetric and positive definite matrix equation `Ax = b`.

    x = A\b;
    x = amg(A,b);
    x = mg(A,b,elem);
    
Backslash `\` is the build-in direct solver of MATLAB. It is suitable for small size problems. `x = amg(A,b)` implements algebraic multigrid solver. To acheive multigrid efficiency, a hierarchical 'grids' is generated from the graph of `A`. When the mesh is avaiable, `x = mg(A,b,elem)` implements geometric multigrid solvers. Inside `mg`, an coarsening algorithm is applied to the mesh given by `elem`. 

More options is allowed in `mg` and `amg`. Try `help mg` and `help amg` for possible options including tolerance, V or W-cycles, number of smoothings steps, and print level etc.

Here we include several examples for discrete Poisson matrices. Solvers for other finite element methods and other equations can be found

## Example: 2-D Linear Element 


```matlab
% setting
mesh.shape = 'square';
mesh.type = 'uniform';
mesh.size = 2e5;
pde = 'Poisson';
fem = 'P1';
% get the matrix
[eqn,T] = getfemmatrix(mesh,pde,fem);
% compare solvers
tic; disp('Direct solver'); x1 = eqn.A\eqn.b; toc;
tic; x2 = mg(eqn.A,eqn.b,T.elem); toc;
tic; x3 = amg(eqn.A,eqn.b); toc;
format shorte
fprintf('Difference between direct and mg, amg solvers %0.2g, %0.2g \n',...
         norm(x1-x2)/norm(eqn.b),norm(x1-x3)/norm(eqn.b));
```

For problem size of $2.6 \times 10^5$, `mg` ties with direct solver `\`. But `amg` is aroud 3-4 times slover.

## Example: 2-D Adaptive Meshes


```matlab
%% Lshape adaptive grids
mesh.shape = 'Lshape';
mesh.type = 'adaptive';
mesh.size = 2e4;
pde = 'Poisson';
fem = 'P1';
% get the matrix
[eqn,T] = getfemmatrix(mesh,pde,fem);
% compare solvers
tic; disp('Direct solver'); x1 = eqn.A\eqn.b; toc;
tic; x2 = mg(eqn.A,eqn.b,T.elem); toc;
tic; x3 = amg(eqn.A,eqn.b); toc;
fprintf('Difference between direct and mg, amg solvers %0.2g, %0.2g \n',...
         norm(x1-x2)/norm(eqn.b),norm(x1-x3)/norm(eqn.b));
```

The finest mesh is several uniform refinement of an adaptive mesh shown above. Now the multigrid outperforms the direct solver around the size of 7e5. amg is 4-5 times slower.

## Example: 3-D Linear Element


```matlab
% Cube uniform grids
mesh.shape = 'cube';
mesh.type = 'uniform';
mesh.size = 2e4;
pde = 'Poisson';
fem = 'P1';
% get the matrix
[eqn,T] = getfemmatrix3(mesh,pde,fem);
% compare solvers
tic; disp('Direct solver'); x1 = eqn.A\eqn.b; toc;
tic; x2 = mg(eqn.A,eqn.b,T.elem); toc;
tic; x3 = amg(eqn.A,eqn.b); toc;
fprintf('Difference between direct and mg, amg solvers %0.2g, %0.2g \n',...
         norm(x1-x2)/norm(eqn.b),norm(x1-x3)/norm(eqn.b));
```

For 3-D linear element, `mg` wins at an even smaller size $3.6\times 10^4$. Again `amg` is 3-4 times slower than `mg`.
