We describe basic idea of the newest vertex and the longest edge bisection
algorithm for two-dimensional triangular grids. In short, a bisection refinement will divide one triangle into two children triangles by connecting one vertex to the middle point of its opposite edge. Another class of mesh refinement method, known as regular refinement, which divide one triangle into 4 similar small triangles, is implemented in `uniformrefine.m`.

There are two main issues in designing a good bisection method.

- (B1) Shape regularity.
- (B2) Conformity. 

## Newest vertex bisection

If one keeps cutting one edge, the smallest angle will decrease and approach
to zero. To keep the shape regularity, we can switch the edge to be
cutted. 

### Newest vertex bisection
Newest vertex bisection is to assign the refinement edge as the
edge opposite to the newest vertex added in the bisection. To begin with,
for an initial triangulation $\mathcal T_0$, we can label the longest edge of each triangle as the refinement edge. Once a initial labeling is assigned to $\mathcal T_0$, 
the refinement edges of all descendants of triangles in $\mathcal T_0$ is
determined by the combinatorial structure of the triangulation. 

It can be shown that all the descendants of a triangle in $\mathcal T_0$ 
fall into four similarity classes and hence (B1) holds. See the following
figure for an illustration

### Refinement edge
How to represent a labeled triangulation? Recall that our representation
of a triangle: `elem(t,[1 2 3])` are global indices of three vertices of
the triangle `t`. The only requirement on the ordering is that the
orientation is counter-clockwise. A cyclical permutation of three indices
still represents the same triangle. We make use of this room and use the rule:

> The refinement edge of `t` is `elem(t,[2 3])`.

In other wordes, for the newest vertex bisection, `elem(t,1)` will be always the newest vertex of the triangle `t`. 

### Completion

Bisect some traingles in a triangulation could result in hanging nodes.
Neighboring triangles should be bisected (again following the newest
vertex rule) to eliminate hangning nodes. This procedure is called
completion.

We now describe an efficient completion algorithm for 2-D triangulations.
A key observation is that if we cut all edges of the current
triangulation (by the newest vertex bisection rule), it results in a
conforming triangulation. Therefore instead of operating on triangles,
we cut enough edges to ensure the conformity. 

Let us denote the refinement edge of `t` by `cutEdge(t)`. We define the
refinement neighbor of `t`, denoted by `refineNeighbor(t)`, as the
neighbor sharing the refinement edge of `t`. When `cutEdge(t)` is on the
boundary, we define `refineNeighbor(t) = t`. Note that `cutEdge(t)` may
not be the refinement edge of `refineNeighbor(t)`. To ensure the
conformity, it suffices to satisfy the rule 

>If `cutEdge(t)` is marked for bisection, so is `cutEdge(refineNeighbor(t))`.

See `bisect.m` adding new nodes section.

```matlab
%% Add new nodes

isCutEdge = false(NE,1);
while sum(markedElem)>0
    isCutEdge(elem2edge(markedElem,1)) = true;
    refineNeighbor = neighbor(markedElem,1);
    markedElem = refineNeighbor(~isCutEdge(elem2edge(refineNeighbor,1)));
end
edge2newNode = zeros(NE,1,'uint32');
edge2newNode(isCutEdge) = N+1:N+sum(isCutEdge);
node(edge2newNode(isCutEdge),:) = (node(edge(isCutEdge,1),:) + ...
                                   node(edge(isCutEdge,2),:))/2;
```

### Bisections of marked triangles
We only need to bisect the triangle whose refinement edge is bisected.
The local numbering is shown in the following figure. We only need to bisect the triangle whose refinement edge is bisected. The local numbering is shown in the following figure. Note that we repeat the bisection only twice. No loop over all triangles. We also need to
update the boundary condition i.e. `bdFlag`.

%% Refine marked elements
Nb = 0; tree = zeros(3*NT,3,'uint32');
for k = 1:2
    t = find(edge2newNode(elem2edge(:,1))>0);
    newNT = length(t);
    if (newNT == 0), break; end
    L = t; R = NT+1:NT+newNT;
    p1 = elem(t,1); p2 = elem(t,2); p3 = elem(t,3);
    p4 = edge2newNode(elem2edge(t,1));
    elem(L,:) = [p4, p1, p2];
    elem(R,:) = [p4, p3, p1];
    elem2edge(L,1) = elem2edge(t,3);
    elem2edge(R,1) = elem2edge(t,2);
    NT = NT + newNT; Nb = Nb + newNT;
end
```

### Initial labeling

Although the completion procedure we proposed will terminate for
arbitrary initial labeling, for the sake of shape regularity, we assign
the longest edge as the refinement edge of each triangle in the initial
triangulation. The subroutine `elem = label(node,elem)` will permute the vertices such that `elem(t,2:3)` is the longest edge of `t`. Note that it  is only need for the initial triangulation. 

## Longest Edge Bisection
It is interesting to note that if we call `label` before each call of
`bisect`, then `bisect` becomes the longest edge bisection since
everytime we switch the refinement edge to the longest edge.

The longest edge bisection will produce shape regular triangulations.
Intuitively the longest edge bisection divides the largest angle, which
in turn prevent forming small angles. Rosenberg and Stenger proved that
by always bisecting the longest edge, the smallest angle possible is half
of the smallest angle in the initial triangulation.
