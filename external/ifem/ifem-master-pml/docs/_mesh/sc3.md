We describe the data structure of the simplicial complex associated to a three-dimensional triangulation give by `node,elem`. The `node` records the coordinates of vertices and `elem` is the pointer from local to global indices of vertices. See [Basic mesh data structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _mesh/basic.md %}).

A brief summary.

- `edge`: ascending ordering, i.e. `edge(:,1)<edge(:,2)`
- `face`: ascending ordering, i.e. `face(:,1)<face(:,2)<face(:,3)`
- `elem`: the default one is the positive ordering and the ascending ordering is mainly used for edge and face elements. 
- Use `[elem,bdFlag] = sortelem3(elem,bdFlag)` to change the ordering to the ascending ordering. Note that `bdFlag` should be switched together. 
- Use `[elem,idx,area,bdFlag] = fixorder3(node,elem,bdFlag)` to change the ordering to the positive ordering.

> The multigrid solvers use the original ordering of `elem` obtained from either uniform refinement or bisection methods. So let `elemold=elem` and use `elemold` in multigrid solvers.

- Examples on the usage: `Poisson3RT0; Maxwell; Maxwell2;`



## Outline

We describe the data structure of the simplicial complex associated to a
two-dimensional triangulation give by `node,elem`. The `node` records
the coordinates of vertices and `elem` is the pointer from the local to
the global indices of vertices. See [Basic mesh data structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _mesh/basic.md %} ).


```matlab
node = [-1,-1,-1; 1,-1,-1; 1,1,-1; -1,1,-1; -1,-1,1; 1,-1,1; 1,1,1; -1,1,1]; 
elem = [1,2,3,7; 1,6,2,7; 1,5,6,7; 1,8,5,7; 1,4,8,7; 1,3,4,7];

The integers `N, NE, NF, NT` represents the muber of vertice, edges, faces, tetrahedron
respectively.

The corresponding simplicial complex consists of vertices, edges, faces, and
tetrahedron. We shall discuss the following three issues:

- *Indexing* of simplexes
- *Ordering* of vertices of simplexes
- *Orientatoin* of simplexes

The indexing and ordering are related and the ordering and orientation
are mixed together. However the indexing has nothing to do with the
orientation. The indexing and ordering are the combinarotry structure,
i.e. only `elem` is needed, while the orientation also depends on `node`,
the geometry emembdding of vertices.

For indexing, ordering and orientation, there are always two versions: local and global. The pointer from the local and the global version is the most complicated issue.



## Indexing

The indexing refers to the numbering of simplexes, e.g., which face is
numbered as the first one. Each simplex in the simplicial complex has a unique index which is called the global index. Inside one tetrahedron, the four vertices and four
faces have their local index  `1:4`. 

In the assembling procedure of finite element methods, an element-wise
matrix using the local index is firstly computed and then assembled to get a
big matrix using the global index. Thus the pointer from the local
index to the global one is indispensible. For bases independent of
the ordering and orientation, e.g., `P1` and `P2` elements, the pointer of indices
is sufficient. 

### Pointers of vertices

The `NT x 4` matrix `elem` is indeed the pointer of the vertex indices. For example `elem(t,1)=25` means the first vertex of  `t` is the 25-th vertex.

Similiary, the `NE x 2` matrix `edge` records the vertices pointer of edges.

### Local indexing of edges and faces

The tetrahedron consists of four vertices indexed as `[1 2 3 4]`. Each
tetrahedron contains four faces and six edges. 

- Opposite indexing `locFace = [2 3 4; 1 3 4; 1 2 4; 1 2 3];`

- Lexicographic indexing `locEdge = [1 2; 1 3; 1 4; 2 3; 2 4; 3 4];`

In `locFace`, the i-th face is opposite to the i-th vertices and thus called *opposite indexing*. In `locEdge`, it is the _lexicographic indexing_ which is induced from the lexicographic ordering of the six edges. The ordering of vertices inside each face or edge will not
change the indexing. For example, the following `locFacec` and `locEdged`
has the same indexing as `locFace` and `locEdge` but with a different ordering
of vertices.

    locFacec = [2 3 4; 1 4 3; 1 2 4; 1 3 2];
    locEdge = [2 1; 3 1; 4 1; 3 2; 4 2; 4 3];

Indeed any permutation of vertex indices will represent the same simplex and
will not change the indexing of the simplex. The ordering of vertices will affect the
orientation and will be discussed later.

For a face consists of three vertices `[1 2 3]`, there are two indexing
schemes of its three edges.

- Oppoiste indexing        `[2 3; 3 1; 1 2]`
- Lexicographic indexing   `[1 2; 1 3; 2 3]`

Each indexing scheme has its advantage and disadvantage and which one
to use depends on the consideration of ordering and orientation.

### Global indexing of edges and faces

One can easily collect edges and faces elementwise. The issue is the
duplication. For example, each interior face will be counted twice. The
`unique` function is applied such that each edge or face has a unique
global index.

**Edge and Face**


```matlab
totalEdge = uint32([elem(:,[1 2]); elem(:,[1 3]); elem(:,[1 4]); ...
                    elem(:,[2 3]); elem(:,[2 4]); elem(:,[3 4])]);
sortedTotalEdge = sort(totalEdge,2);
[edge, ~, je] = unique(sortedTotalEdge,'rows');
display(edge);

totalFace = uint32([elem(:,[2 3 4]); elem(:,[1 4 3]); ...
                    elem(:,[1 2 4]); elem(:,[1 3 2])]);
sortedTotalFace = sort(totalFace,2);                
[face, i2, jf] = unique(sortedTotalFace,'rows');
display(face);
```

In iFEM, `N,NE,NF,NT` represents the number of vertices, edges, faces and tetrahedrons, respectively.

    N = size(node,1); NT = size(elem,1); NF = size(face,1); NE = size(edge,1);

In the assembling procedure, the matrix is always computed elementwise and then assemble to a big one. A pointer from the local index to its global one is thus indispensable.

**Elementwise pointers**

- `elem2node = elem`
- `elem2face(1:NT, 1:4)`
- `elem2edge(1:NT, 1:6)`

Such information is exactly stored in the output of `unique` function. For example, `elem2face(t,1) = 17` means the first face of `t` (spanned by `[2 3 4]`) is the `17`-th face in the `face` matrix. 


```matlab
N = size(node,1); NT = size(elem,1); NF = size(face,1); NE = size(edge,1);
elem2edge = uint32(reshape(je,NT,6));
elem2face = uint32(reshape(jf,NT,4));
display(elem2edge);
display(elem2face);
```


```
elem2edge =

       15    5    6    4
       17   11    9    8
       18   12    9   10
       14   11    3    2
       16   12    6    7



**Face to edge Pointer**

`face2edge(1:NF,1:3)` records the global indices of three edges of a face. This pointer depends on the ordering of vertices of faces and the indexing of local edges. We list the following two important cases. Other combinations are possible but not attractive.

- Ascend ordering.

All local faces and local edges are ascending ordered.    
    locFace = [2 3 4; 1 3 4; 1 2 4; 1 2 3];
    locEdge = [1 2; 1 3; 1 4; 2 3; 2 4; 3 4];
    edgeOfFace = [1 2; 1 3; 2 3];
    locFace2edge = [4 5 6; 2 3 6; 1 3 5; 1 2 4];

- Consistent ordering

The local face is ordered such that the corresponding orientation is
consistent with the induced orientation from the tetrahedron.

    locFace = [2 3 4; 1 4 3; 1 2 4; 1 3 2];
    locEdge = [1 2; 1 3; 1 4; 2 3; 2 4; 3 4];
    edgeOfFace = [2 3; 3 1; 1 2];   
    locFace2edge = [6 5 4; 6 2 3; 5 3 1; 4 1 2];

The global pointer can be obtained from the composition of `elem2face` and
`locFace2edge`. For example, for the ascending ordering scheme,

    face2edge(elem2face(:,1),:) = elem2edge(:,[4 5 6]);
    face2edge(elem2face(:,2),:) = elem2edge(:,[2 3 6]);
    face2edge(elem2face(:,3),:) = elem2edge(:,[1 3 5]);
    face2edge(elem2face(:,4),:) = elem2edge(:,[1 2 4]);



## Ordering

We discuss the ordering of vertices of simplexes. The local and the global ordering  may not be consistent and a sign array can be used to record the inconsistency.

The local ordering refers to the ordering of vertices in `locFace` or
`locEdge`, i.e. the ordering of the local index of vertices. For elements
associated to faces or edges, the local ordering could be used in the
formulation of the local basis and thus the ordering does matter.

The global ordering refers to the ordering of vertices in `face` or
`edge`, i.e., the ordering of the global index of vertices. Note that in either local or global ordering, permutation of vertices will represent the same simplex. To fix an ordering we need extra information.

### elem
The local ordering is always `[1 2 3 4]`. Any permutation of four vertices of a tetrahedron still represents the same tetrahedron. Such freedom provides a room to record more information like: a global ordering of vertices, an orientation of element, and refinement rules (uniform refinement or bisection) etc.

For 2-D triangulations, three vertices of a triangle in 2-D is sorted counter-cloclwise and the first vertex is chosen as the newest vertex. Such ordering enables the efficient implementation of local refinement and coarsening in 2-D; see [Bisection in Two Dimensions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _afem/bisect.md %}) and [Coarsening in Two Dimensions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _afem/coarsen.md %}).

In 3-D, for the longest edge bisection, the newest vertex (with the maximal generation) is stored as the last (4-th) vertex of a tetrahedron. For [3-D Red Refinement]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _mesh/uniformrefine3.md %}).), the ordering determines the shape regularity of refined triangulation. Permutation of vertices in `elem` could deteriorate the angle condition after the refinement.

We shall preserve the ordering of `elem` from the mesh refinement and
coarsening since they are more subtle. We switch the ordering inside the subroutines when generating data structure for finite element basis and assembleing the
matrix equation.

Two types of ordering of `elem` is of particular importantance
- ascend ordering
- positive ordering

In the ascending ordering, the vertices of `elem` is sorted such that 

    elem(t,1) < elem(t,2) < elem(t,3) < elem(t,4)

Ascend ordering will benefit the construction of local bases for high
order Lagrange elements and in general bases with orientation dependent. This can be easily achieved by `elem = sort(elem,2)`. But to include correct boundary conditions, one has to rotate the boundary flag accordingly using `sortelem3`.


```matlab
bdFlag = setboundary3(node,elem,'Dirichlet');
[elem,bdFlag] = sortelem3(elem,bdFlag);    
display(elem);
```


    elem =
    
         1     2     3     7
         1     3     4     7
         1     5     6     7
         1     5     7     8
         1     2     6     7
         1     4     7     8



In the positive ordering, the four vertices are ordered such that the
signed volume is positive.  `fixorder3` will switch the vertices for elements with negative volume. 


```matlab
elem = fixorder3(node,elem)   % switchs the vertices for elements with negative volume.
```


    elem =
    
         1     2     3     7
         1     3     4     7
         1     5     6     7
         1     5     7     8
         1     6     2     7
         1     7     4     8



### edge

For 3-D triangulations, we chose the ascending ordering both locally and globally, i.e.,

    locEdge(:,1) < locEdge(:,2); 
       edge(:,1) < edge(:,2);

Recall that for `locEdge = [1 2; 1 3; 1 4; 2 3; 2 4; 3 4]`, it is ascending ordered. The `edge` produced by `unique` function is also ascending ordered. 

There might be inconsistency between the local and global ordering. Namely `edge(elem2edge(t,1),1) > edge(elem2edge(t,1),2)` may happen. 

### face

For 3-D triangulations, the `face` produced by `unique` function is already sorted in the second dimension such that the global ordering is ascended i.e. `face(:,1) < face(:,2) < face(:,3)`. The local ordering in `locFace`, however, is not always ascend ordered.

```matlab
locFace = [2 3 4; 1 3 4; 1 2 4; 1 2 3]; % Ascend ordering
locFace = [2 3 4; 1 4 3; 1 2 4; 1 3 2]; % Consistent ordering
```

Again the local and the global ordering may not be consistent. That is

    face(elem2face(t,:),1) < face(elem2face(t,:),2) < face(elem2face(t,:),3)

may not be always true unless the ascending ordering is used in both `face` and `locFace`.

## Orientation

The orientation of a tetrahedron is either positive or negative. The
orientation of a face is given by a normal vector and the orientation of
an edge is determined by a tangential vector. 

The orientation of a $d$-simplex will induce an orientation of its $(d-1)$ boundary
subcomplex and is called the *induced orientation*. For example, a positive
orientated tetrahedron will induce the outwards normal orientation of its
four faces and a positive orientated triangle will induce the counter
clockwise orientation of its three edges.

The ordering of vertices of a simplex will naturally introduce an
orientation and will be called the *ordering orientation*. More specifically

- the vector from `edge(:,1)` to `edge(:,2)` defines an orientation of edges.
- the `cross(v12,v13)` defines an orientation of a face, where `vij` is
the vector from vertex `face(:,i)` to `face(:,j)`.
- the sign of the mix product `sign(v12, v13, v14)` defines an orientation for tetrahedrons.

The orientation of a simplex in the simplicial complex should be uniquely
determined which will be called the *global orientation*. It can be chosen as
the global ordering orientation but not always.

Inside one tetrahedron, the local ordering of local edges and local faces
will introduce a corresponding orientation. The orientation of the
tetrahedron will also induce an orientation for its four faces. These are
called the *local orientation* which may not be consistent with the global
orientation. The local ordering orientation is used in the local basis and the induced orientation is used when computing the differential operator locally.

In general, there will be an inconsistency of different types of orientation and appropriate data structure should be constructed to record such inconsistency.

- a global orientation
- the global ordering orientation
- the local ordering orientation inside a tetrahedron
- the local induced orientation inside a tetrahedron

We now discuss the orientation of elem, face, and edge separately. 

### elem

The orientation of a tetrahedron is either positive or negative.
We chose the global ordering orientation, i.e., the sign of the signed
volume computed from `elem`. 

    [Dlambda,volume,elemSign] = gradbasis3(node,elem);

In the output of `gradbasis3`, `volume` is always positive and an
additional array `elemSign` is used to record the sign of the signed
volume.

`Dlambda(t,:,k)` is the gradient of $\lambda_k$ associated to vertex $k$. Therefore the outward normal direction of the k-th face is `-Dlambda(t,:,k)` which is independent of the orientation of element `t`.

### face

Again we use the global ordering orientation determined by `face`. The normal vector is given by `cross(v12,v13)`.

The local ordering orientation is implicitly used when computing finite element basis in each element. For example, the RT0 basis on face `[i j k]` in `locFace` is defined as

$$
\phi_{i,j,k} = 2(\lambda_i \nabla \lambda_j \times \nabla \lambda_k+ \lambda_j \nabla \lambda_k \times \nabla \lambda_i+\lambda_k \nabla \lambda_i \times \nabla \lambda_j).
$$

Odd permutation of `[i j k]` will change the sign of the basis. The direction of $\phi_{i,j,k}$ is the normal vector determined by `[i,j,k]` ordering. Note that this is defined locally, i.e., element by element. 

The global basis associated to a face, however, depends only on the global orientation of this face. We introduce `elem2faceSign(1:NT, 1:4)` to record the inconsistency of a local ordering orientation and a global orientation.

For `locFace = [2 3 4; 1 4 3; 1 2 4; 1 3 2]`, i.e. the induced orientation, the `elem2faceSign` can be obtained from subroutine `dof3face` follows


```matlab
totalFace = [elem(:,[2 3 4]); elem(:,[1 4 3]); elem(:,[1 2 4]); elem(:,[1 3 2])];
elem2faceSign = reshape(sum(sign(diff(totalFace(:,[1:3,1]),1,2)),2),NT,4)
```


    elem2faceSign =
    
         1    -1     1    -1
         1    -1     1    -1
         1    -1     1    -1
         1    -1     1    -1
        -1    -1     1     1
        -1    -1     1     1



When both `elem` and `locFace` are ascending ordered, the orientation of the
global ordering is consistent with that of the local ordering. Thus
`elem2faceSign` is not needed for the ascending ordering when assembling the mass matrix.

But for the ascending ordering system, an `elem2faceSign` will be used when assembling the differential operator because the orientation in the Stokes theorem is the induced orientation. For example, when computing `div` operators on a positive orientated tetrahedron, the faces should be orientated by the outwards normal direction but the global orientation of a face may not be.

If `elem` is positive ordered and `locFace` is consistently ordered, then this inconsistency is already recorded in `elem2faceSign`.

For the ascending ordering of `elem` and `locFace`, we use `1` if the
orientation of a face is the same with the induced outwords normal direction, and `-1` otherwise. Then the inconsistency is  `elem2faceSign = [1 -1 1 -1]` by comparing

- the induced orientation: `locFace = [2 3 4; 1 4 3; 1 2 4; 1 3 2]`;
- the ascending orientation:    `locFace = [2 3 4; 1 3 4; 1 2 4; 1 2 3]`.

Here we use the *ascending orientation* to refer to the orientation given by the ascending ordering.

In summary, 

- the induced orientation is favorable for computing $d\phi$;
- the ascending orientation is favorable for computing $(f, \phi)$ or $(\phi_i, \phi_j)$.

### edge

The orientation of edges is simpler than faces. Globally we always chose the global ascend ordering orientation. Namely the orientation of an edge is from the vertex with the smaller index to the larger one.

The global basis associated to this edge, however, depends only on its 
global orientation. The array `elem2edgeSign(1:NT, 1:3)`  records the inconsistency of a local ordering-orientation and the global orientation.


```matlab
totalEdge = uint32([elem(:,[1 2]); elem(:,[1 3]); elem(:,[1 4]); ...
                    elem(:,[2 3]); elem(:,[2 4]); elem(:,[3 4])]);
direction = ones(6*NT,1,'int8');
idx = (totalEdge(:,1)>totalEdge(:,2));
direction(idx) = -1;
elem2edgeSign = reshape(direction,NT,6)
```


    elem2edgeSign =
    
      6x6 int8 matrix
    
        1    1    1    1    1    1
        1    1    1    1    1    1
        1    1    1    1    1    1
        1    1    1    1    1    1
        1    1    1   -1    1    1
        1    1    1   -1    1    1

For the ascending ordering of `elem` and `locEdge`, the local and the global
orientation will be consistent and no `elem2edgeSign` is needed!

### face to edge

For the ascending ordering `edgeofFace = [1 2; 1 3; 2 3]`, the local and the global ordering is consistent and so is the ordering orientation.

Then it is not consistent with the induced positive (counter-clockwise) orientation of edges. When the edge direction is the same with the induced direction, we use sign `+1`  otherwise `-1`. Then `face2edgeSign = [+1 -1 +1]` records the inconsistency of the ascending orientation of the induced orientation.

For the consistent ordering, `edgeofFace = [2 3; 3 1; 1 2]` which is consistent with the induced positive orientation but then may not be consistent with the global orientation of edges. We construct `face2edgeSign` to record such inconsistency


```matlab
totalEdge = [face(:,[2 3]); face(:,[3 1]); face(:,[1 2])];
direction = ones(3*NF,1);
idx = (totalEdge(:,1)>totalEdge(:,2));
direction(idx) = -1;
face2edgeSignp = reshape(direction,NF,3)
```


    face2edgeSignp =
    
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1
         1    -1     1



## Summary

We summarize the two popular ordering and orientation schemes below.

### Ascend Odering and Orientation

The ascending ordering and orientation is more algebraic, determined by the indices of vertices not the coordinates. 

#### Ascend ordering
The array `elem` is sorted such that

    elem(i,1) < elem(i,2) < elem(i,3) < elem(i,4)

The local face and local edges is also in the ascending ordering

* `locFace = [2 3 4; 1 3 4; 1 2 4; 1 2 3];`
* `locEdge = [1 2; 1 3; 1 4; 2 3; 2 4; 3 4];`
* `edgeofFace = [1 2; 1 3; 2 3];`

Then due to the ascending ordering of `elem`, globally the `edge` and `face` also follow the ascending ordering, i.e.

* `edge(e,1) < edge(e,2);` 
* `face(f,1) < face(f,2) < face(f,3).` 

One can easily see the benefit: the ordering of local edges and local faces is consistent with the global ones and so is their corresponding orientation.

#### Ordering Orientation
We chose the global ordering orientation for each element. 

* `elem: sign(v12,v13,v14)`
* `face`:  the normal vector is given by `cross(v12,v13)`
* `edge`:  from the node with the smaller global index to the bigger one

For faces and edges, the orientation of the ascending ordering and the induced orientation is not consistent. The inconsistency is recorded by

* `elem2faceSign = [1 -1 1 -1];`
* `face2edgeSign = [1 -1 1];`



### Positive Ordering and Orientation

The positive orientation and ordering is geometrically consistent in the sense that the orientation of an element is locally consistent with the orientation of the local boundary faces. But it introduces inconsistency with the global orientation of a simplex. 

#### Positive and consistent ordering

The vertices of `elem` is sorted such that the signed volume is always positive, i.e., the four vertices follows the right hand rule.

The four faces of a tetrahedron are ordered consistently as 

    locFace = [2 3 4; 1 3 4; 1 2 4; 1 2 3];

The six edges of a tetrahedron are still ascending ordered

    locEdge = [1 2; 1 3; 1 4; 2 3; 2 4; 3 4];

Three edges of a face is ordered consistently not ascending

    edgeofFace = [2 3; 3 1; 1 2];

#### Orientation

The ascending ordering orientation is used for the global orientation of `edge` and `face` arrays. The inconsistency of the local and the global orientation is recorded in
`elem2faceSign` and `elem2edgeSign`.



### Example 

We show two tetrahedron with the ascending ordering.


```matlab
% A mesh with two tetrahedron with the ascending ordering
elem = [1 4 5 8; 1 4 5 7];
node = [1,0,0; 1,1,1; 1,-1,-1; 0,1,0; -2,-1,0; 1,1,-1; 0,1,1; 0,-1,-1];
NT = size(elem,1);
showmesh3(node,elem,[],'FaceAlpha',0.25);
findelem3(node,elem);
findnode3(node,elem(:));
display(elem);
% generate edge array
totalEdge = uint32([elem(:,[1 2]); elem(:,[1 3]); elem(:,[1 4]); ...
                    elem(:,[2 3]); elem(:,[2 4]); elem(:,[3 4])]);
sortedTotalEdge = sort(totalEdge,2);
[edge, ~, je] = unique(sortedTotalEdge,'rows');
display(edge);
% generate face array
totalFace = uint32([elem(:,[2 3 4]); elem(:,[1 4 3]); ...
                    elem(:,[1 2 4]); elem(:,[1 3 2])]);
sortedTotalFace = sort(totalFace,2);                
[face, i2, jf] = unique(sortedTotalFace,'rows');
display(face);
% generate pointers of indices
elem2edge = uint32(reshape(je,NT,6))
elem2face = uint32(reshape(jf,NT,4))
% find orientation of elem
[v,elemSign] = simplexvolume(node,elem)
```


    elem =
    
         1     4     5     8

Since we are using the ascending ordering, the inconsistency with the induced orientation is 
* `elem2faceSign = [1 -1 1 -1];`
* `face2edgeSign = [1 -1 1];`
