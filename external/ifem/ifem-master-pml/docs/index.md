## Introduction to iFEM
*i*FEM is a [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/) software package containing robust, efficient, and easy-following codes for the main building blocks of adaptive finite element methods and multigrid methods on unstructured simplicial grids in both two and three dimensions. Besides the simplicity and readability, sparse matrixlization, an innovative programming style for MATLAB, is introduced to improve the efficiency.



## Installation

You can download the repository at [https://github.com/lyc102/ifem](https://github.com/lyc102/ifem), or alternatively you can get iFEM by using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyc102/ifem.git
```

Then use MATLAB to run the `setpath.m` script in the root folder to add all the sub-folders to your MATLAB path. 

<!-- [Octave](www.octave.org) version is also available at [https://github.com/lyc102/ifemOctave](https://github.com/lyc102/ifemOctave). -->



## Help, Guides, and Contributing

This documentation website will be constantly updated. If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:lyc102@gmail.com). If you like to suggest an additional equation to be implemented in iFEM, please go to the [GitHub repo submit an issue](https://github.com/lyc102/ifem/issues). If you like to contribute to the development of iFEM, please see our [Community hub page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/research.md %}).

### Use MATLAB help/doc
1. `help funexample` displays a description of and syntax for the function `funexample`. For example, `help mg` will show basic usage for `mg` function in the plain text.  
2. `ifem funexampledoc` show detailed description. For example, `ifem mgdoc` will explain the `mg` function step by step in `html` format. But not every function has a html documentation. Contribution to a documentation page is also welcome.
