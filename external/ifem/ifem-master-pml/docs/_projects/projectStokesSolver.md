The purpose of this project is to implement fast solvers for solving
finite element and finite difference discretization of Stokes equations.

## Part I: Block Preconditioner

Given a triangulation, use codes in [Project: Finite Element Methods for Stokes Equation](projectStokes.md) to generate matrices for isoP2-P0 and P1CR-P0 for Stokes equations. 

### Step 1: Direct solvers in preconditioner 

Use $\begin{pmatrix} A^{-1} & 0\\ 0 & Mp^{-1}\end{pmatrix}$ as the preconditioner and call `minres`.

Do not use `inv(A)` to form the inverse. Instead the preconditioner can be coded as a subroutine and use backslash to invert `A`. 

For isoP2-P0 and P1CR-P0, the mass matrix for pressure is a diagonal
matrix. The inverse of Mp can be realized by a vector multiplication.

Refine the triangulation several times and list the iteration steps of
`minres` and cpu time. The steps should be uniform but the time may not be
linearly scaled due to the direct solver used in the preconditioner. Use
`showrate` to check the scaling of cpu time vs size of problems.

### Step 2: Replace direct solver by multigrid solver

The direct solver of `A` can be replaced by multigrid solvers included in
ifem. Try `help mg` or `help amg`.

To use `mg`, the mesh structure `elem` should be provided. So you need to
modify the matrices to build in the Dirichlet boundary condition. If you
only take out submatrices associated to free dofs, you can use `amg`.

Redo the test in step 1. You should get the same iteration steps and now
the cpu time scales linearly. 

### Step 3: Replace exact multigrid solver by V-cycles

Set `option.maxIt = 3` and redo the test. The iteration steps could
increase but cpu time is saved instead. How about `option.maxIt = 1`?

# Part II: Block-triangular Preconditoner

Use $\begin{pmatrix}A & B'\\ 0 & -Mp \end{pmatrix}^{-1}$ as the preconditioner and call `gmres`.

Repeat three steps in Part I and compare the cpu time for these two preconditioners.
